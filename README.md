# Abstract
In this paper, we propose a cooperative multi-elevator control system implemented on the Nexys4 DDR FPGA board using VHDL in the Vivado environment. To achieve efficient elevator scheduling and accurate response to user requests, we design two key software modules: a centralized request handler that assigns external floor requests based on a direction-priority and minimum-distance algorithm, and three elevator control modules that independently manages internal commands and elevator states. Subsequently, we develop a hardware simulation system using external LEDs and push buttons to emulate floor indicators and internal/external call buttons. This ensures that both internal and external requests are processed correctly, and the elevator system behaves in a realistic manner. A VHDL testbench is also constructed to simulate and verify the function of our proposed control module. Finally, the hardware implementation is validated under three typical scenarios: a single external request, multiple concurrent requests, and peak usage conditions. The results demonstrate the robustness and practicality of our FPGA-based elevator control solution.
